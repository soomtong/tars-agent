# Writing Cyber (guide for agents who know Python)

Cyber has a syntax structure very close to Python. Blocks are made by indentation, statements end at a newline, and you use `for`, `while`, `if`, `fn`, `use` and `print` with almost the same feel. But Cyber is statically typed, has value ownership, and has no exceptions. These parts differ, so consult this document when you compose code. Do not guess an unfamiliar construct from Python; check the lists below first.

The reference version is Cyber 0.4.10-DEV at commit 5de6c83a of soomtong/cyber (`cyber version` prints `Cyber 0.4.10-DEV build-0-5de6c83a` for a build of that commit). Older Cyber syntax in your training data (`my`, `dyn`, `func`, `throw`, `catch`, `'$(x)'`, `#[generator] fn f()`, the symbol literal `@name`) is wrong. Write `generator fn f()` and `symbol.name`.

Cyber is still gaining features. This document matches one build and can fall behind a newer one. Before you use or edit this document, check the following.

- Run `cyber version` and compare the real build with the reference version above.
- Re-run the 10 examples in this document on the build, once with the CLI and once in an agent session (the same VM, persist_main, validate before eval). If one fails, the document is stale.
- Test the "Missing features" list, the "Differences from Python" list and the "Methods that exist" lists against the build, one item at a time. If a feature now exists, remove it from the document or fix the entry (for example the json, regex and time modules, or `xs.map`).
- If the document and the build disagree, the build is right. Fix the document and update the reference version.

If you want a feature that this document does not list, do not assume it exists. Run a small piece of code to check.

## Principles

- Write simple code where the types are visible. int, float, bool, str, []T, Map, ?T, !T and types with plain fields are enough.
- Use heap references `^T`, borrows `&T`, `move`, traits, templates, generators and `spawn` only when you must.
- A call that returns `!T` needs `!` before you print or use the value: `print(f()!)`, not `print(f())`.
- Declare every new variable with `:=` the first time, also inside loops and `if` blocks. `x = ...` only changes a variable that already exists.
- Call only the methods listed in "Methods that exist". If you are not sure a method exists, run a small piece first.
- Compile errors appear before execution and carry a line number. Most messages say how to fix the code. Do what the message says.

## Same as Python

- Indented blocks, the colon, `pass`, `break`, `continue`, `return`
- `and`, `or`, `not` with the same precedence as Python: `not a and b` is `(not a) and b`, and `not a == b` is `not (a == b)`
- `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` for numbers and strings (strings compare by bytes), `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`
- Function calls `f(x)`, method calls `s.upper()`, indexing `xs[0]`, the idea of slicing `s[1..3]`
- Single and double quotes are the same for strings. Strings are immutable UTF-8.
- `[]T`, which you use like a list, shares its buffer on assignment (the same aliasing as a Python list)
- `max(a, b)` and `min(a, b)` for two values of the same type

## Differences from Python

Syntax. Each line is Python, then the Cyber form.

- `# comment` becomes `-- comment`
- `x = 1` (declare and assign are the same) becomes `x := 1` to declare and `x = 2` to reassign. `:=` again in the same block is an error.
- `def f(a, b):` becomes `fn f(a, b int) -> int:`. Parameter types and the return type are required. Group equal types as `a, b int`.
- `elif c:` becomes `else c:` (not `else if`)
- `for x in xs:` becomes `for xs |x|:`. With the index: `for xs |i, x|:` (the index comes first)
- `for x in ['a', 'b']:` becomes `for {'a', 'b'} |x|:`
- `for i in range(n):` becomes `for 0..n |i|:` (end excluded). `0..=n` includes the end. `n..>0` counts down.
- `f"{x}"` becomes `'%{x}'` interpolation. Expressions work: `'%{a + b}'`
- `x if c else y` becomes `if (c) x else y`. The parentheses around the condition are required.
- `a // b` becomes `a / b`. Integer division truncates toward zero. `//` is an error. Power `**` is the same.
- `import math` becomes `use math`. For a file: `use g 'geo.cy'`
- A function is declared only at the top level, not inside `if`, `for` or another function.
- `class P:` becomes `type P:` with fields such as `name str` below it. A method is `fn (&P) m():` and uses `self` inside.
- `P(name='a', n=1)` becomes `P{name='a', n=1}`. A field is set with `=`, not `:`.
- `print(a, b)` becomes `print(x)`. It takes exactly one argument. Join values with interpolation.
- `len(xs)` becomes `xs.len()`. It is a method. `xs.len` is an error.
- `xs.append(1)` becomes `xs += 1` or `xs = xs.append(1)`. Methods that change the size return a new value, so you must take it.
- `x in xs` becomes `xs.contains(x)`, and for a Map `m.contains(k)`
- `[1, 2, 3]` becomes `{1, 2, 3}`. The list takes the type of its first element (`[]int`), and every other element must have that type. An empty list needs the type: `[]int{}`. You can always write the type: `[]str{'a', 'b'}`.
- `{"a": 1, "b": 2}` becomes `Map[str, int]{a=1, b=2}`. A bare name is a string key. Put an expression key in parentheses: `Map[str, int]{(k)=1}`. An empty Map is `Map[str, int]{}`.
- `(1, 2)` tuple becomes `type Pt(x, y float)` for a named tuple, or a struct
- `None` becomes `none`. Only inside a `?T` type.
- `assert` becomes `use test`, then `test.eq(expected, actual)`
- `if __name__ ...`: top-level statements are the program. Or declare `fn main()` (mixing the two is an error).

Semantics:

- Typing is static. A type error appears as a CompileError before a single line runs. A variable cannot change its type.
- There is no truthiness. The `x` in `if x:` must be a bool. Write `if xs.len() > 0:`. Bitwise operators are `&&`, `||` and `~`. Logic is `and`, `or` and `not`.
- Integers and floats are separate. `int + float` is an error, and the right operand is fitted to the type of the left one. Convert explicitly: `float(i) + f`. A float with an integer value prints as `5`, not `5.0`.
- A function cannot read a local variable of the outer scope. Pass it as a parameter, or declare a global with `global g int = 0`.
- Using a call that returns a value as a statement is an error. To discard the value, write `_ = f()`.
- A function that returns a value must return on every path. Otherwise: `Missing return statement.`
- There are no default parameter values and no keyword arguments. Use overloading.
- `return` is not allowed at top level.
- A list literal without a type takes the type of its first element, and the other elements must have that type: `{1, 'a'}` and `{1.5, 2}` are errors. Write the type: `[]float{1.5, 2}`.
- A one-character string `'s'` becomes a code point (115) where an integer is expected, without an error: `[]int{1, 'a'}` is `{1, 97}`. If you doubt a variable's type, check it with `var n int = ...`.
- String indexing and `len()` count bytes. Use `s.count()` for the number of characters.
- A backslash in a string must be one of `\n`, `\t`, `\r`, `\0`, `\\`, `\'`, `\"` or `\xHH`. Any other (`\|`, `\d`, `\.` in a grep or regex pattern) is a compile error. Write the backslash twice: `'a\\|b'`.
- Map iteration follows hash order, not insertion order. If you need an order, copy the keys or entries into a list and sort it.
- A negative index `xs[-1]` panics. Use `xs.last()` or `xs[xs.len() - 1]` for the last element.
- A slice can omit its start or end: `s[..3]`, `s[2..]`. `s[1..3]` excludes the end and `s[1..=3]` includes it. Negative bounds are not allowed. Python's `s[:-1]` is `s[..s.len() - 1]` (`s[..-1]` panics).
- `xs[5]` out of range panics, and `m[k]` on a missing key panics. `m.get(k)` returns `?V`.
- Integer overflow wraps around. Division by zero panics.
- A number can contain the digit separator `_`: `1_000_000`, `0xff_ff`.
- `fiber`, `suspend` and `scope` are reserved words. Do not use them as variable or function names. Do not use fibers or `scope` blocks: call capabilities one at a time, in sequence.

## Methods that exist

These are all the methods of the three types you use most. A Python method that is not here does not exist under its Python name. Look for the Cyber name under "Python name to Cyber name". Method names are snake_case: `starts_with`, not `startsWith`.

str (strings do not change; every method returns a new value):

- `s.len()` bytes, `s.count()` characters
- `s.contains(sub)`, `s.starts_with(p)`, `s.ends_with(p)`, `s.index(sub)` and `s.lastIndexOf(sub)` give `?int`
- `s.split(sep)` gives `[]str`, `s.replace(old, new)`, `s.upper()`, `s.lower()`, `s.repeat(n)`, `s.concat(t)`
- `s.trim()` cuts spaces, tabs and newlines at both ends. `s.trim({'-', '_'})` cuts the given characters.
- `s.last()` the last byte

[]T:

- `xs.len()`, `xs.contains(x)`, `xs.index(x)` gives `?int`, `xs.last()`
- `xs.join(sep)` for `[]str`, gives `str`
- `xs.append(x)`, `xs.insert(i, x)`, `xs.remove(i)`, `xs.clear()`: each returns the new list; take it: `xs = xs.remove(0)`
- `xs.sort()` sorts in place in ascending order (numbers and strings). `xs.sort(|a, b| ...)` sorts by a function that returns true when `a` goes first. Both return nothing.

Map[K, V]:

- `m[k]` (panics when missing), `m.get(k)` gives `?V`, `m[k] = v`, `m.set(k, v)`
- `m.contains(k)`, `m.size()`, `m.keys()` gives `[]K`, `m.remove(k)`, `m.clear()`
- `for m |e|:` gives entries with `e.key` and `e.value`

Python name to Cyber name:

- `sep.join(xs)` is `xs.join(sep)` (the list joins, not the separator)
- `xs.find(x)` is `xs.index(x)`, which gives `?int`: `xs.index(x) ?else -1`
- `xs.pop()` is `v := xs.last()` then `xs = xs.remove(xs.len() - 1)`
- `s.startswith(p)` and `s.endswith(p)` are `s.starts_with(p)` and `s.ends_with(p)`
- `s.strip()` is `s.trim()`
- `s.find(sub)` is `s.index(sub)` and `s.rfind(sub)` is `s.lastIndexOf(sub)`. Both give `?int`. For the last part of a path use `p.split('/').last()`
- `len(m)` is `m.size()`. `m.items()` is `for m |e|:`. `list(m)` is `m.keys()`
- `sorted(xs)` is `xs.sort()`, which changes `xs`. `sorted(xs, reverse=True)` is `xs.sort(|a, b| a > b)`

## Sorting

`xs.sort()` is ascending. For any other order give a function: `|a, b| a > b` for descending, `|a, b| a.n > b.n` for a field.

To sort by a value in a Map, the function must reach the Map. A lambda can use an outer variable only when it is declared with `^` (a heap reference). Declare the Map with `^` from the start, and use it as a normal Map:

~~~cy
counts := ^Map[str, int]{}
for {'b', 'a', 'b'} |w|:
    counts[w] = (counts.get(w) ?else 0) + 1
names := counts.keys()
names.sort(|a, b| counts[a] > counts[b] or (counts[a] == counts[b] and a < b))
~~~

A borrow `c := &counts` before the lambda also works inside a function, but not at the top level of an agent run: a top-level borrow cannot be kept between runs (`Cannot persist local ... of borrow type`). When you need more than one value per item, copy the items into a list of structs and sort by a field, as in example 4.

## Missing features

list comprehensions, the `lambda` keyword (a lambda is written `|a, b| a + b` and only where the type is known), generator expressions, decorators, `with`, `try/except`, `raise`, inheritance, `*args`, `**kwargs`, `xs.map`, `xs.filter`, `abs`, `sum`, `sorted`, `enumerate`, `zip`, f-strings, the ternary `?:`, semicolons, `i++`.

The json, regex and time modules are not in the Cyber standard library now and are under construction (docs/decisions/0010). Update this document when they land. Until then, solve the task with str methods or a capability function.

## Errors and Option (instead of exceptions)

- A value that may be absent has type `?T`. To unwrap: `if x |v|:`, `x ?else default`, `x.?` (panics when absent).
- `?else` and `!else` take the whole rest of the expression as the default. Put them in parentheses inside a larger expression: `(h() ?else '') == 'server'`, `(f() !else 0) + 1`.
- An operation that may fail returns `!T`. A failure is `return error.Name`. The caller uses `f()!` (pass the failure to the caller; the enclosing function must return `!U`), `f() !else default`, or a `f() !else |e|:` block (the block must end with `return` or `panic`).
- `s.index(x)` gives `?int`. Test it with `if s.index(x) |i|:` (found at `i`) and `else:`, or with `if idx == none:`. `not idx`, `idx >= 0` and `idx!` are errors.
- `!` and `!else` work only on a `!T` value. On a `?T` (such as `s.index(x)`) use `?else`, `.?` or `if x |v|:`.
- To handle several calls together, use a `try:` block with `!` inside and receive the failure in `else |e|:`.
- `panic('msg')` cannot be caught. Use it for program bugs only. Return normal failures as `!T`.
- An error from `f()!` at the top level, or returned by `fn main() -> !T`, is an uncaught error and ends in a panic. To print a failure and go on, wrap the top-level code in a `try:` block and print it in `else |e|:` (a top-level `!else` block cannot end with `return`).
- A call that returns `!T` must be handled, even `!void`. A bare `fs.write(p, s)` is an error. Write `fs.write(p, s)!` inside `try:`, or `fs.write(p, s) !else |e|:`.
- Unwrap a `!T` before you use the value: `x := r()!`, then `x.len()`. `print(r())` and `r().len()` are errors.
- `int('abc')` gives 0 without an error. When you need validation, use `int.parse(s) !else ...`.

## Values, references, borrows

- Struct assignment copies. It is not shared like a Python object. `q := p; q.age = 9` does not change p.
- To share, lift the value to the heap with `^`: `p := ^P{name='a', age=3}`. Read and write fields as `p.age`, and use `p.*` for the whole value.
- An operator on a reference works on the value it points to only through `.*`: `n.* += 2`, `out.* += 'x'` for `out := ^[]str{}`.
- To let a function modify an argument, declare `fn inc(p &int)` and call `inc(&a)`.
- `Array[T]` cannot be copied. Use `move a` to pass or relocate it. Using the original after a move is an error. For an ordinary list use `[]T`.
- A closure can only capture variables of type `^T` or `&T`. In simple code use a plain function or a loop instead of a closure.
- Top-level variables persist between runs, but a top-level borrow (`c := &x`) cannot. Borrow inside a function, or use `^T`.

## Examples

1. Declarations, interpolation, control flow

~~~cy
total := 0
for 1..=10 |i|:
    if i % 2 == 0:
        total += i
    else i == 7:
        total += 100
print('total=%{total}')
~~~

2. Functions and type conversion

~~~cy
fn mean(xs []int) -> float:
    sum := 0
    for xs |x|:
        sum += x
    return float(sum) / float(xs.len())

print(mean({1, 2, 3, 4}))
~~~

3. Building and sorting a list (take the value that append returns)

~~~cy
names := {'bob', 'alice'}
names += 'carol'
names = names.append('dave')
names.sort()
print(names.join(','))
~~~

4. Counting with a Map, then sorting the words by count (do not rely on hash order)

~~~cy
type WordCount:
    word str
    n int

counts := Map[str, int]{}
for 'the cat and the hat'.split(' ') |w|:
    counts[w] = (counts.get(w) ?else 0) + 1

rows := []WordCount{}
for counts |e|:
    rows += WordCount{word=e.key, n=e.value}
rows.sort(|a, b| a.n > b.n or (a.n == b.n and a.word < b.word))
for rows |r|:
    print('%{r.word}: %{r.n}')
~~~

5. Struct, methods, copy semantics

~~~cy
type Account:
    name str
    balance int = 0

fn (&&Account) deposit(n int):
    self.balance += n

fn (&Account) summary() -> str:
    return '%{self.name}: %{self.balance}'

a := Account{name='kim'}
a.deposit(50)
b := a
b.deposit(1)
print(a.summary())
print(b.summary())
~~~

6. Option

~~~cy
fn first_even(xs []int) -> ?int:
    for xs |x|:
        if x % 2 == 0:
            return x
    return none

if first_even({1, 4, 5}) |v|:
    print('found %{v}')
print(first_even({1, 3}) ?else -1)
~~~

7. Returning and handling an error

~~~cy
fn safe_div(a, b int) -> !int:
    if b == 0:
        return error.DivByZero
    return a / b

fn describe(a, b int) -> str:
    q := safe_div(a, b) !else |e|:
        return 'failed: %{e}'
    return 'ok: %{q}'

print(safe_div(9, 3) !else -1)
print(describe(9, 3))
print(describe(1, 0))
~~~

8. Error propagation and the try block

~~~cy
fn parse_sum(a, b str) -> !int:
    x := int.parse(a)!
    y := int.parse(b)!
    return x + y

try:
    n := parse_sum('4', '5')!
    print(n)
    m := parse_sum('4', 'x')!
    print(m)
else |e|:
    print('bad input: %{e}')
~~~

9. enum and switch (no else needed when every case is covered)

~~~cy
type Level enum:
    case low
    case high

fn label(l Level) -> str:
    switch l:
        case .low: return 'L'
        case .high: return 'H'

print(label(Level.high))
~~~

10. Shared reference and borrow

~~~cy
fn bump(n &int):
    n.* += 1

x := 1
bump(&x)

shared := ^x
alias := shared
alias.* = 10
print('%{x} %{shared.*}')
~~~

## Errors whose message does not say the fix

Most compile errors say how to fix the code, for example `Did you mean starts_with?`, `Write else cond:, not else if cond:`, `Unwrap it with ! first`. Follow those. The errors below do not, so the cause and the fix are given here. Each line is the first line of the error.

- `Expected end of line or file. Got ...`: `let`, `def`, `class`, `lambda x:`, a semicolon. Rewrite in Cyber syntax.
- `Expected right operand.`: `i++`, `10 // 3`, a `//` comment. Write `i += 1`, `/`, `--`.
- `Expected `]`.`: a list comprehension. Write a `for` loop that appends.
- `Expected `,`.` in a function declaration: a default parameter value. Remove it and add an overload.
- `Expected closing parenthesis.` in a call: a keyword argument `f(a=1)`. Pass it by position.
- `Expected a target type or at least one element.`: an empty `{}`. Write `[]int{}` or `Map[str, int]{}`.
- `Expected type `str`, got `int`.` (or another pair of types) in a list literal: the elements have different types. A list has the element type of its first element.
- `Expected type `bool`, got `int`.`: a truthy condition. Use a comparison.
- `Expected `int`, found `float`.`: int and float mixed. Match them with `float(i)`.
- `Variable `x` is already declared in the block.`: repeated `:=`. Write `x = ...`.
- `Undeclared variable `x`.` inside a function: an outer local variable. Pass it as a parameter, or use `global`.
- `Undeclared variable `abs`.` (also `sum`, `sorted`, `enumerate`, `zip`): a Python builtin. See "Missing features" and write a loop.
- `Can not find the symbol `map` in `[]int`.` (also `filter`): write a loop.
- `Type `str` does not have a field named `len`.`: `s.len`. Write `s.len()`.
- `Expected `1` arguments, found `2`, when calling the function `fn print(...)``: write `print('%{a} %{b}')`.
- `Can not find the symbol `&&` for `bool`.`: logical AND. Write `and`.
- `Expected assignment to a variable or placeholder ...`: a call whose value is discarded. Write `_ = f()` or assign it to a variable.
- `Cannot persist local ... of borrow type ... across evals.`: a top-level `c := &x`. Use `^T`, or borrow inside a function.
- `Cannot copy ..., type implements `NoCopy`.`: copying an Array. Use `[]T`, or `move`.
- `Return statement is not allowed in the main block.`: a top-level return. Wrap the code in `fn main():`.
- `Missing return statement.`: some path has no return. Add a return at the end.
- ``fn` declarations are not allowed here.`: a function inside a block. Declare it at the top level.
- `Import path does not exist`: `use json`, `use regex`, `use time`. These modules are missing.

Runtime panics: `Out of bounds index: -1` is a negative index (use `xs.last()`), `OutOfBounds` on a slice is a negative or too large bound, and `MissingKey` is `m[k]` on a missing key (use `m.get(k)`).

An error raised inside a template can point to a line of a standard module (the module name and line, such as `core:196:5`) instead of your code. Check the call expression yourself.
